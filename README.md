please bare in mind that i have created two git-basic-execirses, the first one i created it while i was doing basic introduction to github and i noticed later,
that there is an actual execise that i will have do exactly that. but this is the correct execirse.
i thought i knew how to use git but no i did not. this is interesting a challenging. i noticed that when i check my commit history it only shows initial commit while i did second and third commits.
i am trying to check the problem by doing another commit
